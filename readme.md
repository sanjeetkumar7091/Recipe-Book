Recipe Book Web Application

Project Description:
This is a Recipe Book web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and search for recipes. Recipes are stored locally in the browser to persist data across sessions.

Features:
- Add new recipes with name, ingredients, preparation steps, and an image.
- View all added recipes in a visually appealing card layout.
- Click on a recipe to view detailed information in a modal.
- Search recipes by name or ingredients with instant filtering.
- Data persistence using browser localStorage.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

How to Use:
1. Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.
2. Use the "Add a New Recipe" form to input recipe details and optionally upload an image.
3. Click "Add Recipe" to save the recipe.
4. View recipes in the "Recipes" section.
5. Click on any recipe card to see detailed information.
6. Use the search box to filter recipes by name or ingredients.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

Notes:
- Images are stored as base64 strings in localStorage, so large images may increase storage usage.
